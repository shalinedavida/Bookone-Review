        <p id="explanation">The book outlines the struggles of Noah Trevor as a mixed person <br>born during apartheid in 
            SouthAfrica and how life was for him during<br> and after that time and how he is clearly the odd ball almost<br>
             everywhere he goes and the racism and segregation he encountered as a mixed <br>person born to a white swiss father and black mother.

             <p id="abel">Patricia was an independent woman .A carefree woman who did as she pleases .<br>
             This appealed to Abel who came from a patriachial society where women <br>
            typically obeyed men and were stay at home mums.He wanted a <br>
            traditional marriage with Patricia just to live out his dream <br>
            and cage her. Treat her how women were supposed to be according<br> to where he came from.
            For an instance when he got married to her he started <br>
            limiting her long hour church periods .<br><br><br>
            He complained of how the society would view him as a man<br>
             when he let his wife out of the house for long periods.
            This resonates with the current<br> gender roles whereby women
             are still  not allowed to arrive late in the house whereas<br>
             their male counterparts do it freely without the need to be questioned. If a woman arrives late back home and<br>
              gives the excuse of running late because of work it is seen as
              invalid but for the male<br>it is allowed after all he is the head of the family.
            
            
            Abel also refused to let  Patricia take Noah<br> to visit his dad .This was because of
             his egoistic personality because he felt like it was an insult<br> on him.
            This is something that is clearly evident in the current society where men tend to<br>
             get married to single parent women and end up destroying the co-parenting <br>
            with theri childrens father. This is mostly because they have trust issues and <br>
            feel like if they let the two have such a  relationship it might lead to something
             else .<br> Some even go as far us forcing the mothers to take back the kids to<br> their fathers and cut all contacts with them.
            I have personally witnessed this<br> from an older friend who is like a sister to me. <br><br><br>
            Their current spouse made them cut contact with <br>their kid all in the name of they
              cannot father another mans child which is clearly<br> absurd. The fact that he himself stayed in 
              contact with his kids from his previous marriage<br> made the situation all the way worse.
            This just goes to show that the patriarchal society<br> from the '60s still quite exists.The men tend to consider themselves superior to the women.<br>
            In relationships today men still expect to have<br> submissive women .Women they can push around however they want and<br>
             if they find that you are opposite from what they expect they try to cage you.<br>
            To turn you into a dummy .When you defy there orders<br> it turns into a whole other issue like domestic violence which <br>
            is clearly potrayed in Trevor Noahs book when Abel physically assaults Patricia.<br>
            In the Kenyan society it has even gotten worse to<br> the point that there are a lot of femicide cases.The cases were<br>
             too much that in 2023 women protested in towns and centers like Nairobi .<br>
            All these femicide cases originated from one point which was abusive and toxic partners.
