            <p> <b>Romantic love: </b> Trevor's first ever romantic crush(love) was a girl named Zaheera, whom <br> he found very beautiful, and as he described her, a silent, shy, and well-mannered girl, <br> whom he made a friend afraid of rejection, and with the thought of her being out of his <br> league. And he was thinking about working on it in the long run, thinking that he would <br> have more time to spend with her, which eventually wasn’t the case, and she left the <br> country to go abroad. And later on, he learns from her friends that she was interested in <br>him, which taught him a lesson about acting on time and to have courage.
                <br> <br>

                A lesson that Trevor highlights in the book that he learnt was that you do not own the <br> people you love . This lesson was brought about by his love for his dog Fufi.He <br> mentions how Fufi could do a bunch of things, like jumping over the perimeter wall <br>during the day and going out to some other kid's house. The day that he followed Fufi <br> and found this out, it hurt him so much that he felt like he was being cheated on . In his <br> head, he loved Fufi, which meant Fufi was his, but in a real sense, Fufi was just a dog <br> that he loved, and Fufi was allowed a life of his own. This story comes up as an <br> important lesson he learnt in life, which he later applied to his personal romantic life. He <br> learnt that you just have to love people, and the people you love have no obligation <br> toward you and can have a life of their own because they do not belong to you just <br> because you love them.
                <br> <br>
               <b>Familial love:</b>  growing up with his mom, Trevor learnt the love that his mother had for <br> him and the sacrifices that she made to raise him well and to show him what he <br> deserves. There was this quote from the book which he used to describe that, which <br> was “Love is a creative act. When you love someone you create a new world for them. <br> My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things I learned, I <br> came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her.”

        <h2>Feeling Like an Outsider</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="feelinglikeanoutsider">
        <div class="feelinglikeanoutsider_parag">
            <p>Trevor Noah, both as an individual and a celebrity, recounts a part of his school life <br> where he felt invisible. In his book, he reflects on his lack of popularity and the <br> absence of a defined clique, contrasting his experience with his peers, such as the <br> white students who gathered together or the black kids from the township who <br> played soccer together. As the only mixed-race student among a school population <br>of over a thousand, he often felt alone and out of place. As Trevor Noah states in his <br> book, “It is easier to be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider as an insider”
                <br> <br>
                This experience resonates strongly in today's world and generation, particularly for <br> international students. For instance, being a Black African student in a study-abroad <br> program poses unique challenges that many may not fully understand. The <br> distinctions between you and other students become painfully apparent, and <br> sometimes, even fellow Black students may create a divide, perceiving a difference <br> between themselves as African Americans and you as an African student.
                <br> <br>
                To cope with these challenges, many African students tend to form supportive <br> groups among themselves. Additionally, seeking therapy sessions has become a <br> common strategy, helping them navigate the feelings of isolation often experienced <br> in a foreign environment.
                <br> <br> 
                Another instance of feeling like an anomaly individually is being raised by <br>  guardians . This came up from a discussion where an experience of being raised <br> in an extended family took away the opportunity for familiarity among the <br> household members. This led to the feeling of being the odd one out, where you <br> tend to feel like you are not recognized and you are not seen . In the context of <br> Trevoh Noah’s book, I highly resonate with his experiences where he felt like he <br> did not fit in and created his little world for himself.  This was how he coped with <br> the fact that he was among people, yet  alone ,this tends to happen frequently.

            <p>Patricia acts as the sole caregiver and protector to Trevor. Raising Trevor she is a strict <br>mother, but she is strict with him in order to impact positive values in Trevor. She <br> believes being strict with Trevor is what helps in shaping him into a better person <br> with values. These values that Trevor learns guide who he becomes a person and <br>instills discipline in him. Particia is also hard working and does what she can to <br>ensure that they are able to support themselves financially. This character inspires <br>Trevor and pushes him in his career. Trevor also comes out as hardworking and <br>does everything needed to achieve his goal. For example, in his CD and DJ job, <br>where he gets local fame, Trevor runs the business with hard work and passion. It <br> is through his actions that he is able to see his business develop and grow. <br>Patricia’s resilience also teaches Trevor to always stand on what is right. She goes <br>against various societal expectations and does what she thinks is right. <br> <br>

                When Trevor makes a mistake in school instead of reprimanding or punishing him, <br>Patricia weighs on the matter and uses it to impact meaningful lessons to Trevor. <br>There is a time that Trevor takes the communion which he is supposed not to take. <br>He gets reprimanded by the school. When Patricia gets to know of this, she <br>addresses the matter by thinking it is not right to deny a child that. Patricia did not <br>just follow the rules but instead questioned them and only abided by what was <br>right. Through all these, Trevor learns to always stand up for what is right. <br> <br>
                
                Additionally, raising Trevor as a mixed race child during the apartheid times is very <br>challenging to Patricia. This is most especially due to the fact that she is the sole <br>protector to Trevor and mixed people in the society were viewed differently.Despite <br>the struggles, she goes through all means to ensure that Trevor is raised well. She <br>does what she can to ensure that Trevor gets only what is best. It is through <br>Patricia that Trevor learns English as she gets him books to read and also teaches <br>him. This is also seen when she takes Trevor to a private school that is majorly for <br>the whites so that he can get better education. She also takes different kinds of <br>jobs to make ends meet and provide for the needs of Trevor. All these measures <br>ensure that Trevor gets a good upbringing. It also molds him into being able to <br>interact well with diverse people. She allows Trevor to explore things she never did <br>and most blacks were not allowed to.

        <h2>Indentity: Given vs Chosen</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="identity">
        <div class="">
            <p>Trevor’s existence in the first place is a crime since it was not allowed for people to marry from <br> different races.Under apartheid regime Trevor is classified as coloured  a category that set him <br> apart from his  black Mother Patricia and his  white father Robert.
                This identity dictates where <br>Trevor can live with his associates and how the people view him.For <br> instance when Patricia  take Trevor to stay with his grandmother so that he can be safe,while he <br> is the grandmothers place is detained to play with the childrens around him because if the police <br>  could spot it could be a case hence this affected Trevor which made him to feel discriminated <br> and also he could not walk with his mother openly.
                <br>  <br> Despite the limitations of the assigned identity,Trevor put more effort into defining himself on his <br>  own terms. His mother took a huge role to teach him how to fight the societal limitation to define <br>  his own path of being independent and emphasis on faith. He used his adaptability and honour <br>  to navigate different social groups since Trevor could even talk different languages that is <br>  English,Xhosa and Africaners; this was a strength that helped him to manoeuvre among the <br>  groups interactively while breaking the boundaries of race and culture.
                <br>  Trevor’s journey is one of self-improvement as he continues to learn to restore the identity<br>  assigned to him  and the identity he chooses to become and he also comprehends the strength <br> and determination to maintain and express their unique identity even when faced with social and <br>  cultural  pressure to adapt.
